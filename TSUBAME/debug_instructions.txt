I have created a new script named `debug_job.sh` to help diagnose the issue.

This script will:
1.  Run for 10 minutes on the `q` queue as you requested.
2.  Print every command it executes into the `simulation.err` file.
3.  Log environment details like the Python path, installed packages, and GPU status.

Please submit this new script and check the contents of `simulation.out` and especially `simulation.err`. The `simulation.err` file should now contain a detailed execution log that will help us find the problem.

To run the debug job:
```bash
qsub debug_job.sh
```

After the job finishes, please show me the content of `simulation.err` and `simulation.out`.
