I have updated the `setup_env.sh` script to fix the errors.

Please follow these steps to rebuild your environment and run the simulation:

1.  **Delete the old environment** to ensure a clean start:
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/python-venvs/macemp_env
    ```

2.  **Run the updated setup script** to create a new, correct environment:
    ```bash
    bash setup_env.sh
    ```

3.  **Submit the debug job again**:
    ```bash
    qsub debug_job.sh
    ```

This should resolve the errors. Please let me know how it goes.
